You don't need to do anything, MODx cares about everything once the plugin is installed. 

Advanced options
----------------

While editing any document in the site tree a new HyperPalenor area appears under the Resource content area and Template Variables. The area displays URLs which when called would redirect to the current Document. You can add New redirection URLs by hand, but MODx will also do the work automatically : when you rename or move a document, its previous URL will be added to the list of Redirected URLs. 

To remove Redirect URLs, uncheck them and save the Document.
